(Why he would recommend a\\nIIvx over an LCIII I don't know, but that's what he said.)\\n\\nSo, what does the net think? Did the dealer just get one flaky\\nmachine, or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early?\\nIs your C610 working just great, or is it buggy too?\\n\\n\\tJay Scott\\n\\tscott@cs.uiuc.edu\\n\"]"

There are many reasons why a single number, such as the index value, is not used to represent an item’s position in transformer models. For long sequences, the indices can grow large in magnitude. If you normalize the index value to lie between 0 and 1, it can create problems for variable length sequences as they would be normalized differently.\n",
